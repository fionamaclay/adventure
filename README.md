# Adventure Game
> A text-based, choose-your-own-adventure game in Python executed by the player in the terminal.

This is a project I'm working on in my computer coding class to learn Python. Check it out!

### **How to Play**
---


Want to play? 
1. Download [adventure_game.py](adventure_game.py)
2. In the terminal type:

```
python adventure_game.py
```
3. After being welcomed, use **look** to see where you are:
```
> look
```

4. Then, use **go** followed by a cardinal direction. For example:
```
> go east
```
5. Look around your area and use **take** to pick up items. For example:
```
> take book
```
6. To check your **inventory**, type:
```
> inventory
```
You have the basics. Feel free to take a look!
